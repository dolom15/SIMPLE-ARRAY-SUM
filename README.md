# SIMPLE-ARRAY-SUM
The simpleArraySum function iterates via range-based for loop to add all elements and return the total, and the main outputs the result to a file. This program calculates the sum of an integer array by using utility functions (ltrim, rtrim, split) to parse input: reads array size, then elements as a space-separated string, and converts to a vector.
